                climate change, wide societal collapse through nuclear war and
                untold suffering, antibiotic-fueled epidemics that bring the
                very species to its knees.

                But humans are resilient creatures. They’ll survive the
                onslaught. They’ll rebuild. They’ll recreate a civilization
                where ours stood originally, unknowingly borrowing pieces of our
                culture and identity, but largely forgetting about their
                origins.

                Eventually, they’ll remember us. They’ll study us. Some lost
                flash memory here or there, an unusually well preserved RAID
                drive in a basement that somehow survived the near boundless
                destruction of the world above. Each fragment gives incredible
                insight into how people lived before we came up against the
                great filter the first time.

                And one day, one anthropologist, sorting through the remains of
                what could have been an old office building, stumbles upon the
                discovery from which hundreds of papers and untold accolades
                stem. She holds it carefully in her hand: A perfectly preserved
                2TB hard drive.

                She sends it off to the lab in New York (now amusingly located
                about 20 miles south of modern day Manchester) and waits
                patiently while they sort through the slog of not so randomly
                aligned magnetic fields.

                The team pulls out an old adapter and spins up the disk on a
                device purpose-built to study this exact kind of artifact. They
                pull a remarkably clean section of data off of the disk, and
                start their analysis. A slightly distorted header field here. A
                bunch of unorganized data there. Old tomes, digitized, are
                parsed and sifted through with incredible accuracy, until one
                possible match arises. A very old… video codec?
